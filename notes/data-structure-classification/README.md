* Queues
* Stacks
* Heaps

## [Non-Linear](./non-linear-data-structures.md)

* Tree
* Tables
* Containers

## [Homogeneous](./homogeneous-data-structures.md)

* 2D Arrays
* Multi-dimensional Arrays

## [Heterogeneous](./heterogeneous-data-structures.md)

* Linked lists
* Ordered lists
* Unordered lists

## [Dynamic](./dynamic-data-structures.md)
