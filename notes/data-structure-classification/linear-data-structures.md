# Linear Data Structures

## Lists

A list is a sequence of elements with each element containing a link to either the next or previous (or both) element.

## Tuples

A tuple is a finite sorted list of elements. Typically these are immutable sequential collecitons. 


## Heaps

A heap is a data structure based on the heap property. This data structure is used in selection, graph, and k-way merge algorithms.
